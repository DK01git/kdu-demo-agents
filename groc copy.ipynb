Gen Z has popularized the Friendsgiving holiday which is flexible but typically within a week of Thanksgiving.\n",
      "After all we will probably drink more Budweiser, eat more Doritos and consumer more chicken wings on Sunday than any time in our nation’s history. We may fall short on the percent of Americans who consume pumpkin pie, but Super Bowl Sunday is clearly a time for gathering with friends. We will also buy squares to see if we win the score at the end of the first quarter and bet on everything from the coin flip winner to the first TD scored.\n",

      "Plenty of VIPs will be in attendance from Taylor Swift to Donald Trump . Who knows maybe we’ll be able to bet on the first celebrity sighting?\n",
      "Viewing Trends & Predictions for Sunday’s Chiefs Vs. Eagles Game\n",
      "Best estimate for watching is in the range of 100 to 150 million viewers.\n",
      "The Kansas City Chiefs' victory over the Buffalo Bills averaged 57.4 million viewers on CBS, making it the most-watched AFC Championship game in National Football League (NFL) history. The numbers for the NFC Championship weren't quite as high. According to the Sports Business Journal, the Eagles 55-23 win over the Commanders drew 44.2 million.\n",

      "Cost of Tickets\n",
      "The Super Bowl is the most popular sporting event in the world, and despite the Chiefs and Eagles meeting just two years ago in the Super Bowl, the matchup is still bringing in fans. Ticket prices have moved up and down dramatically as the game approaches.\n",
      "“Pricing on this event has been very consistent with the last Super Bowl matchup between the Chiefs and Eagles in 2023, showing just a 2 percent increase in the average ticket price,\" said Dustin Ray, senior vice president of business intelligence at TFL. \"With that being said, we've seen increased demand in terms of volume, with fans still excited to see this historic matchup.\" As of this week tickets started at $5,122 each on ticketsforless.com .\n",
      "Cost of Suites\n",
      "Demand for suites from companies and fans is still high, too – the most accessible suites are still over half a million dollars, with many going for $1 million or more. There are a total of 165 suites in the Caesars Superdome.\n",
      "Cost of Accommodations\n",
      "Compared to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas last year, hotel rooms are harder to come by as the selection is more limited in New Orleans than in Sin City. Many fans are looking to Airbnb, VRBO and alternatives.\n",
      "Once the Chiefs and Eagles were announced, Airbnb saw a surge of nearly 400% for searches for stays in New Orleans over comparable days in 2024. According to Airbnb, top origin cities in order include:\n",
      "Philadelphia\n",
      "Kansas City\n",
      "New York\n",
      "Jersey Shore\n",
      "Los Angeles\n",
      "Arlington\n",
      "Dallas\n",
      "South Florida Atlantic Coast\n",
      "Jersey City\n",
      "Chicago\n",
      "I contacted Airbnb Chief Business Officer Dave Stephenson and he commented, “Our brand helps cities scale accommodations for major events. We have hosted nearly 700,000 guests during the Paris 2024 Olympics, which was the biggest single event in our company's history. New Orleans provides another great opportunity to provide accommodations for the surge of guests looking to catch the Chiefs vs. Eagles.”\n",
      "For those with a big budget you’ll find the Kismet which is currently docked in New Orleans and available for charter at $3,000,000 per week plus expenses. Key highlights include a 7-star wellness suite, complete with a hammam, sauna and cryotherapy chamber’” commented AJ Blackmon, who operates a superyacht family office advisory named Ikonic Yachts. \"The trend of superyachts at the Super Bowl really came into play at the 2020 game in Miami. It was a way to not only entertain but also stay in style an anchor away.”\n",
      "Let’s Bet\n",
      "Nearly 68 million American adults — about 1 in 4 — plan to bet on this year’s Super Bowl, setting a record by a wide margin, according to the American Gaming Association .\n",
      "According to Fan Duel here are some of the most popular bets:\n",
      "Moneyline: 59% of bets on the Eagles; handle split almost even with 51% on the Chiefs\n",
      "Spread: 57% of bets and 55% of handle on the Chiefs\n",
      "Any Time TD Scorer: Most popular are Saquon Barkley, Jalen Hurts, Kareem Hunt\n",
      "Personally, I’ll bet I eat a few too many chicken wings, can’t get on the Kismet for a quick tour and talk about the Super Bowl ads Monday after the game.\n",

      " The 2025 edition of the Super Bowl, which saw the Philadelphia Eagles emerge victorious against the Kansas City Chiefs was watched by 127.7 million viewers in the United States, making it not only the most watched Super Bowl in history, but also the most popular TV program of all time in the U.S. The second most watched Super Bowl was aired in the previous year, when the Kansas City Chiefs won against the San Francisco 49ers. What is the Super Bowl? The Super Bowl is the last game of the NFL season with the winners of the two football conferences, the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC), competing with each other. The game determines the champion of the National Football League. The first Super Bowl was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 football season. In that game, the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, then of the American Football League, with a score of 35 to 10, winning the first-ever Super Bowl championship.  Super Bowl giants The Super Bowl came into being as part of a merger agreement between the two rival football leagues (National Football League and the American Football League) at the time. From 1967 to 1970, the game pitted the champions of the two rival leagues against each other. Since 1971 and the completion of the merger agreement, the winners of the two conferences have squared off against each other. The Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots have won the most Super Bowl titles , with a total of six each. The Patriots have also appeared in the National Football League’s annual championship game a record 11 times, thereby topping the list for Super Bowl appearances .\n",

      "After all we will probably drink more Budweiser, eat more Doritos and consumer more chicken wings on Sunday than any time in our nation’s history. We may fall short on the percent of Americans who consume pumpkin pie, but Super Bowl Sunday is clearly a time for gathering with friends. We will also buy squares to see if we win the score at the end of the first quarter and bet on everything from the coin flip winner to the first TD scored.\n",

      "Viewing Trends & Predictions for Sunday’s Chiefs Vs. Eagles Game\n",
      "Best estimate for watching is in the range of 100 to 150 million viewers.\n",
      "The Kansas City Chiefs' victory over the Buffalo Bills averaged 57.4 million viewers on CBS, making it the most-watched AFC Championship game in National Football League (NFL) history. The numbers for the NFC Championship weren't quite as high. According to the Sports Business Journal, the Eagles 55-23 win over the Commanders drew 44.2 million.\n",

      "Cost of Tickets\n",
      "The Super Bowl is the most popular sporting event in the world, and despite the Chiefs and Eagles meeting just two years ago in the Super Bowl, the matchup is still bringing in fans. Ticket prices have moved up and down dramatically as the game approaches.\n",
      "“Pricing on this event has been very consistent with the last Super Bowl matchup between the Chiefs and Eagles in 2023, showing just a 2 percent increase in the average ticket price,\" said Dustin Ray, senior vice president of business intelligence at TFL. \"With that being said, we've seen increased demand in terms of volume, with fans still excited to see this historic matchup.\" As of this week tickets started at $5,122 each on ticketsforless.com .\n",
      "Cost of Suites\n",
      "Demand for suites from companies and fans is still high, too – the most accessible suites are still over half a million dollars, with many going for $1 million or more. There are a total of 165 suites in the Caesars Superdome.\n",
      "Cost of Accommodations\n",
      "Compared to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas last year, hotel rooms are harder to come by as the selection is more limited in New Orleans than in Sin City. Many fans are looking to Airbnb, VRBO and alternatives.\n",
      "Once the Chiefs and Eagles were announced, Airbnb saw a surge of nearly 400% for searches for stays in New Orleans over comparable days in 2024. According to Airbnb, top origin cities in order include:\n",
      "Philadelphia\n",
      "Kansas City\n",
      "New York\n",
      "Jersey Shore\n",
      "Los Angeles\n",
      "Arlington\n",
      "Dallas\n",
      "South Florida Atlantic Coast\n",
      "Jersey City\n",
      "Chicago\n",
      "I contacted Airbnb Chief Business Officer Dave Stephenson and he commented, “Our brand helps cities scale accommodations for major events. We have hosted nearly 700,000 guests during the Paris 2024 Olympics, which was the biggest single event in our company's history. New Orleans provides another great opportunity to provide accommodations for the surge of guests looking to catch the Chiefs vs. Eagles.”\n",
      "For those with a big budget you’ll find the Kismet which is currently docked in New Orleans and available for charter at $3,000,000 per week plus expenses. Key highlights include a 7-star wellness suite, complete with a hammam, sauna and cryotherapy chamber’” commented AJ Blackmon, who operates a superyacht family office advisory named Ikonic Yachts. \"The trend of superyachts at the Super Bowl really came into play at the 2020 game in Miami. It was a way to not only entertain but also stay in style an anchor away.”\n",
      "Let’s Bet\n",
      "Nearly 68 million American adults — about 1 in 4 — plan to bet on this year’s Super Bowl, setting a record by a wide margin, according to the American Gaming Association .\n",
      "According to Fan Duel here are some of the most popular bets:\n",
      "Moneyline: 59% of bets on the Eagles; handle split almost even with 51% on the Chiefs\n",
      "Spread: 57% of bets and 55% of handle on the Chiefs\n",
      "Any Time TD Scorer: Most popular are Saquon Barkley, Jalen Hurts, Kareem Hunt\n",
      "Personally, I’ll bet I eat a few too many chicken wings, can’t get on the Kismet for a quick tour and talk about the Super Bowl ads Monday after the game.\n",

      "Cost of Tickets\n",
      "The Super Bowl is the most popular sporting event in the world, and despite the Chiefs and Eagles meeting just two years ago in the Super Bowl, the matchup is still bringing in fans. Ticket prices have moved up and down dramatically as the game approaches.\n",
      "“Pricing on this event has been very consistent with the last Super Bowl matchup between the Chiefs and Eagles in 2023, showing just a 2 percent increase in the average ticket price,\" said Dustin Ray, senior vice president of business intelligence at TFL. \"With that being said, we've seen increased demand in terms of volume, with fans still excited to see this historic matchup.\" As of this week tickets started at $5,122 each on ticketsforless.com .\n",
      "Cost of Suites\n",
      "Demand for suites from companies and fans is still high, too – the most accessible suites are still over half a million dollars, with many going for $1 million or more. There are a total of 165 suites in the Caesars Superdome.\n",
      "Cost of Accommodations\n",
      "Compared to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas last year, hotel rooms are harder to come by as the selection is more limited in New Orleans than in Sin City. Many fans are looking to Airbnb, VRBO and alternatives.\n",
      "Once the Chiefs and Eagles were announced, Airbnb saw a surge of nearly 400% for searches for stays in New Orleans over comparable days in 2024. According to Airbnb, top origin cities in order include:\n",
      "Philadelphia\n",
      "Kansas City\n",

      "Chicago\n",
      "I contacted Airbnb Chief Business Officer Dave Stephenson and he commented, “Our brand helps cities scale accommodations for major events. We have hosted nearly 700,000 guests during the Paris 2024 Olympics, which was the biggest single event in our company's history. New Orleans provides another great opportunity to provide accommodations for the surge of guests looking to catch the Chiefs vs. Eagles.”\n",
      "For those with a big budget you’ll find the Kismet which is currently docked in New Orleans and available for charter at $3,000,000 per week plus expenses. Key highlights include a 7-star wellness suite, complete with a hammam, sauna and cryotherapy chamber’” commented AJ Blackmon, who operates a superyacht family office advisory named Ikonic Yachts. \"The trend of superyachts at the Super Bowl really came into play at the 2020 game in Miami. It was a way to not only entertain but also stay in style an anchor away.”\n",
      "Let’s Bet\n",
      "Nearly 68 million American adults — about 1 in 4 — plan to bet on this year’s Super Bowl, setting a record by a wide margin, according to the American Gaming Association .\n",
      "According to Fan Duel here are some of the most popular bets:\n",
      "Moneyline: 59% of bets on the Eagles; handle split almost even with 51% on the Chiefs\n",
      "Spread: 57% of bets and 55% of handle on the Chiefs\n",
      "Any Time TD Scorer: Most popular are Saquon Barkley, Jalen Hurts, Kareem Hunt\n",
      "Personally, I’ll bet I eat a few too many chicken wings, can’t get on the Kismet for a quick tour and talk about the Super Bowl ads Monday after the game.\n",

We may fall short on the percent of Americans who consume pumpkin pie, but Super Bowl Sunday is clearly a time for gathering with friends.

      "Best estimate for watching is in the range of 100 to 150 million viewers.\n",
      "The Kansas City Chiefs' victory over the Buffalo Bills averaged 57.4 million viewers on CBS, making it the most-watched AFC Championship game in National Football League (NFL) history. The numbers for the NFC Championship weren't quite as high. According to the Sports Business Journal, the Eagles 55-23 win over the Commanders drew 44.2 million.\n",

      "Cost of Tickets\n",
      "The Super Bowl is the most popular sporting event in the world, and despite the Chiefs and Eagles meeting just two years ago in the Super Bowl, the matchup is still bringing in fans. Ticket prices have moved up and down dramatically as the game approaches.\n",
      "“Pricing on this event has been very consistent with the last Super Bowl matchup between the Chiefs and Eagles in 2023, showing just a 2 percent increase in the average ticket price,\" said Dustin Ray, senior vice president of business intelligence at TFL. \"With that being said, we've seen increased demand in terms of volume, with fans still excited to see this historic matchup.\" As of this week tickets started at $5,122 each on ticketsforless.com .\n",
      "Cost of Suites\n",
      "Demand for suites from companies and fans is still high, too – the most accessible suites are still over half a million dollars, with many going for $1 million or more. There are a total of 165 suites in the Caesars Superdome.\n",
      "Cost of Accommodations\n",
      "Compared to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas last year, hotel rooms are harder to come by as the selection is more limited in New Orleans than in Sin City. Many fans are looking to Airbnb, VRBO and alternatives.\n",
      "Once the Chiefs and Eagles were announced, Airbnb saw a surge of nearly 400% for searches for stays in New Orleans over comparable days in 2024. According to Airbnb, top origin cities in order include:\n",
      "Philadelphia\n",
      "Kansas City\n",
      "New York\n",
      "Jersey Shore\n",
      "Los Angeles\n",
      "Arlington\n",
      "Dallas\n",
      "South Florida Atlantic Coast\n",
      "Jersey City\n",
      "Chicago\n",
      "I contacted Airbnb Chief Business Officer Dave Stephenson and he commented, “Our brand helps cities scale accommodations for major events. We have hosted nearly 700,000 guests during the Paris 2024 Olympics, which was the biggest single event in our company's history. New Orleans provides another great opportunity to provide accommodations for the surge of guests looking to catch the Chiefs vs. Eagles.”\n",
      "For those with a big budget you’ll find the Kismet which is currently docked in New Orleans and available for charter at $3,000,000 per week plus expenses. Key highlights include a 7-star wellness suite, complete with a hammam, sauna and cryotherapy chamber’” commented AJ Blackmon, who operates a superyacht family office advisory named Ikonic Yachts. \"The trend of superyachts at the Super Bowl really came into play at the 2020 game in Miami. It was a way to not only entertain but also stay in style an anchor away.”\n",
      "Let’s Bet\n",
      "Nearly 68 million American adults — about 1 in 4 — plan to bet on this year’s Super Bowl, setting a record by a wide margin, according to the American Gaming Association .\n",
      "According to Fan Duel here are some of the most popular bets:\n",
      "Moneyline: 59% of bets on the Eagles; handle split almost even with 51% on the Chiefs\n",
      "Spread: 57% of bets and 55% of handle on the Chiefs\n",
      "Any Time TD Scorer: Most popular are Saquon Barkley, Jalen Hurts, Kareem Hunt\n",
      "Personally, I’ll bet I eat a few too many chicken wings, can’t get on the Kismet for a quick tour and talk about the Super Bowl ads Monday after the game.\n",
